# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Basics

**Welcome to the world of Prompt Engineering!**  
This repository introduces the core concepts, techniques, and examples for crafting effective prompts to interact with AI models like GPT, Claude, and others.

## 📌 What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art of designing inputs (prompts) that guide AI models to produce accurate, creative, or useful outputs.  
Think of it as giving clear instructions to a super-smart assistant who can do almost anything — if you ask the right way!

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- :bulb: Improves AI response quality  
- :hammer_and_wrench: Helps solve complex tasks with simple instructions  
- :sparkles: Enables creative applications like chatbots, summarizers, and generators

## 🧰 Core Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero-shot Prompting** | Asking the model without examples. Simple and direct.                     |
| **Few-shot Prompting**  | Providing examples to guide the model’s behavior.                         |
| **Chain-of-Thought**    | Encouraging step-by-step reasoning in the response.                      |
| **Role-based Prompting**| Assigning a role to the AI (e.g., “You are a math tutor”).                |
| **Instruction Tuning**  | Using structured commands like “Summarize this in 3 bullet points.”       |

## 🧪 Example Prompts

```markdown
"Translate the following sentence to Urdu: 'Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world.'"

"You are a career coach. Help me write a professional LinkedIn summary for an AI intern."

"Summarize this research paper in beginner-friendly language with analogies."
